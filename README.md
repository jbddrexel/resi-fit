Resi-Fit “Where U Hustle for Your Last Name”
The app that gauges your adeptness and overall financial stability in the establishment of residual income. In the words of the Late “Nipsey Hustle”, “You aren’t on a real bag if it isn’t Mailbox money’! Our App fills in the gap through gauging their financial literacy and their ability to allocate small amounts of money towards assets that provide monthly, quarterly, and annual dividend payments. Our target audience is people between the ages of 16-65; no one is too young or too old to learn how to develop residual income for themselves or for their families. 


Far Vision: The end-state for this application is to foster a developmental environment where anyone of all ages can learn how to strategically invest for their future through the medium of residual income. The average American only learns about and how to invest their hard-earned income through a traditional 401k; this must change. Instead of being reliant upon a jobs ability to invest your money, you can learn the small nuclei of the stock market and invest after learning each mediums capability. 
Strategic investors have a greater likelihood of achieving their goals due to structured and refined plans prior to ever entering the market. This what makes them successful, THEY ARENT LOOKING TO GET RICH QUICKLY!! They understand building financial stability takes time and consistency. Our overall goal is to reach 100 million individuals who will successfully gauge their abilities and successfully institute their plan to reach self-identified financial goals. 


Near Vision: Our immediate objective is to gain a clear perspective of the relative information needs of our stakeholders in respect to their financial goals. Due to the fluid dynamics of service members lives and college student lives we understand attention to detail is key and fluidity of information is essential. Our engagements w/ stakeholders will enable us to gain a clear picture of our product backlog requirements. This information will garner the attraction of future constituents whom will observe the value in our service and actively participate within the platform. 


It is estimated we will have nearly 1000 participants or greater prior to actual product launch due to our organizations access to our target audience. 
Version 1.0 is focused upon ease of use, timely and accurate information from external financial sources (i.e. Tradingview, Yahoo Finance) internal Income calculators to accurately gauge the finance sectors economically suitable for our clients. Regardless of their economic status our app will provide focused outlines of target achievable investment opportunities and provide continuous tracking of our client’s goals through metrics-based outputs. These will be provided internally within the app. 


Stakeholder User Stories
Terrell Skinner: Executive Director and Founder of The Skinner Foundation
https://www.houseofskinnercorp.org/
He is owner of a Non-Profit seeking to expand upon teaching financial literacy. His organization is presently working with the Pinnellas County School district to bring a financial literacy program to its students. He is also a US Army Veteran who recognizes the importance of this information and its impact for service members, and the rigors of the lifestyle. 

Needs:  
-	Classes on how to read the market. Present different options for long term investment other than 401k 
-	Some kind of protection plan in case the market ain’t doing well. At that SES level folks are more concerned about how to survive. 
-	Understanding finances is the first pillar, this can be done through the app by just simple giving the user a financial construct on how they should budget. Letting them adjust as appropriate while also giving explanations as to why something is a good idea vs a bad idea (obviously based on their income) I think the podcasting would work well with familiar faces that look like them endorsing the app that will also help with buy in.
-	Access to reading material that will break down different strategies (also a glossary with words I should know) (Definitely a High Priority, easy dictionary development/function)
-	Access to be able to have live chats with advisors. (Based upon API connectivity – Medium Priority – May require additional Resources)


Stakeholder 2 User Story: 


CW3 Jermain Marcus


US Army


Mr. Marcus is a guiding light in the US Army Warrant Officer community, operating within a technical atmosphere influencing the mindset and operational readiness of our soldiers in the Ordinance & Logistics Corp. Entering the US Army at the age of 22, surrounded by exceptional leaders he learned budgeting and investing where key to his financial stability being a career soldier. 

Needs: 
-	An app that can teach soldiers terminology in a simplistic manner and breaks down effective strategies of investing that educate through active participation. (Dictionary capability, budget calculator, burn – down chart depicting effective tract of reaching financial goal)
-	Access to be able to have live chats with advisors. (Based upon API connectivity – Medium Priority – May require additional Resources)
-	Maybe a weekly podcast (you bring on different people you learned from) as another resource for folks who aren’t big readers to listen. (Long-term initiative w/ strong implementation capability), Low to medium priority for development
-	Access to my money at anytime.  (Requires linking of financial information – Long term initiative – Low Priority for Implementation)


Stake Holder User Story 3:


Inky Matthews


College Student at The University of Alabama


A Science and Technology major, working towards opening her own Mechanical Bio-Science business; has always wanted a greater and more detailed explanation toward investing. While there are a number of venues she’s been approached by, she has yet to find one that truly educates its users in simplistic fashion. College students have minimal capital to work with, and an extreme tool toward paying off student loans faster can be executed through investing. Investing is how she was able to shift the financial outlook and opinion of members within her family. 

Needs:
-	An app that finds enables students to find the sweet spot for folks to thrive while working through renewing their mind not just in literacy but how to structure their finances.
-	Some kind of protection plan in case the market isn’t doing well. (A lack of financial acumen raises this concern, an app that teaches students how to hedge against market decline. 
-	Quarterly newsletter about different tips and how informative maybe a weekly podcast can be influential in their growth and educational experience (you bring on different people you learned from) as another resource for folks who aren’t big readers to listen.
-	Long Term: Incentives to invest more money I.e., if I invest x amount I will get a credit to buy more stock. 
-	An app with a strong social media recognition, cultural relativity and something that centralizes itself around college life and working towards our future goals. A social culture that fosters a dream building environment. 


Product Backlog (Ordered)

Rationale - the backlog has been ordred, for the most, according to most essential application functionality to have a minimum functioning product. Only the developers took part in estimating the time to complete the PBIs. Whole team relative size estimating was also done to help gauge the difficulty of each item in relation to another by using the Affinitiy Method of relative sizing. 

Below is a link to our backlog but you will not be able to access it unless we approve you as a user. Thus, we've put a sample of the backlog here to give an idea of what we're working on.

## SPRINT 1

**Forecast Number of Story Points to Be Completed - 3**

**Rationale** - Using what we learned from class, we know that humans tend to be overly optimistic when estimating how muych work they can complete in a given time frame (guilty!). Given this information, we feel we have chosen a very achievable amount of work for our first sprint. Further, we know that we can adjsut for future sprints with techniques such as "Yesterday's Weather". We can use this technique to set our sprint forecast for sprint two based on what we were able to accomplish in sprint one. **Only developers participated in pulling user stories into the sprint backlog.**

**Backlog Items for the Sprint**
- As a service member/student, there should be a website I can visit that will have various sources of financial information and documents. - 1 story point

## Kanban Board Link:
- Our Kanban Board is a YouTrack Kanban board. To organize things in some sort of logical manner, we utilitized the "swimlane" feature which is essentially a grouping mechanism for an "epic". In this case, the "epic" is the user story and the cards in the swimlane are one user story card and multiple task cards which symbolize developer tasks. The task cards are linked to the user story card as a way of showing logical ordering of what cards are associated with each other. The user story card will always be at the top of the "done" section with the tasks below it to further signify that the tasks are subitems of the user story. In this sprint, we pulled three user stories into our sprint backlog and thus we have three swim lanes on our Kanban board, one for each user story and it's associated tasks.

	- Kanban Board
	- Sprint Burndown Chart
	- Schedule Stakeholder for Sunday
- John
	- Add links to more strategies
	- Add images to README for Pair Programming
	- Investigate more robust unit tests
			
## Questions Answered in Scrum:
- Do you see any impediment that prevents the Developers from meeting the Sprint Goal? 
	- Testing this website is going to be a little bit cumbersome. We need to figure out whether we should use Selenium which contains a lot more overhead or work with the requests library that is not as robust but lighter weight.
	- Credbility and consistency of information across our linked sources
- What are the impediments? 
	- Functionality of unittest testing library with the website.
	- Information from our various sources could be misleading, false, inaccurate or inconsistent.
- What is your impediment removal plan?
	- We can start with the requests library in Python and ensure that all the webpages return a success of 200. If the functionality of the requests library seems sufficient, we can continue to work with this library. Otherwise, we can pivot to Selenium which will have some requirements for others attempting to run the tests outside our group but will give us more robust testing functionilty.
	- We will need to vette our sources and the consitency of the information we are linking to our site on an ongoing basis via the daily scrum and other methods. As the site grows, we can devise a more automated / efficient way to validate the sources on a large scale.

## Unit Tests and Pair Programming
The unit tests thus far primarly consist of automated HTML requests to various parts of the website that should or should NOT be working.
Mike and John pair programmed on the development of the unit tests for which we have included a screenshot of this task below. Our unit tests are in the resifit_unittests.py file in our repo and we have included the output of our tests passing successfully below as well.

## Sprint Review
- All three sprint backlog items were completed during the sprint. Our site is up and running and can be visited by clicking the link provided in the above section of the README! Below is a list of the items that were completed during the sprint with relevant details regarding the completion of the item.

**Backlog Items for the Sprint**
- As a service member/student, there should be a website I can visit that will have various sources of financial information and documents. - 1 story point
	- Developer Tasks
		- Create a shell front end that will mostly serve as a placeholder for future functionality
			- Launch new website using Wix - **Completed by Mike and John**
				- **Notes: pretty straight forward. Probably the toughest part was settling on a template that we felt would embody our site's vision. Making a choice when presented with many options is tough!**
			- Customize layout to generally align with longer term design of site (contact page, about page, placeholders for sprint work, etc.) - **Completed by Mike and John** 
				- **Notes: the site is flexible and well laid at this point to satisfy the goals of this sprint as well as to serve as a long term solution**
			- Add information to website from Github README to flesh out website **Complete by Mike** 
				- **Notes: straight forward, however tedious, copy and pasting given the details were already fleshed out in the README. We wanted to ensure that the information we put forth embodied the values of the Skinner Foundation and great time and care was given to ensure this**
		- Create a section on the resources page that will house the links financial information and documents. Title the section "Financial Document Resources". - **Completed by John** 
			- **Notes: time-consuming combing the web for relevant and trustworthy resources for this section.**

- As an Educator, I want to have access to different strategies a service member/student can use to protect their money in a financial downturn in a simplistic teachable format. - 1 story point
	- Developer Task
		- Create a section on the resources page titled "Protective Strategies" or something of the like that will have the links to the materials describing the strategies. - **Completed by John** 
			- **Notes: Similiar to adding links for financial information and documents, it was time consuming and challenging to find the right content.**
			- 
- As a service member/student, I want to be able to click on links that lead me to trustworthy and educational financial materials - 1 story point
	- Developer Task
		- Create a section on the resources page that will have links to this broader category of information. Title it "Educational Sources". - **Completed by John** 
			- **Notes: Similiar to adding links for financial information and documents, it was time consuming and challenging to find the right content.**
		- Test Usable Links and Library of Financial Information - **Completed by John** 
			- **Notes: Writing the tests to ensure the links are working was tough as well as Wix does not let users change the IDs on Wix generated objects. Further, many websites have safeguards in place to block programmtica HTML acces. Ultimately, I was able to write tests to ensure the links are working.**

**Sprint Review Takeaways**
- Overall, it seemed Terrell was impressed with the intial progress we have made. He like the structure of the site and the general layout. He also liked the content and felt that it was appropriate.
- We generally are of the consent that these first few sprint should focus on infrastructure building that is flexible and highly customizable as the product vision is proving to be a living, breathing thing.
- We added two new items to our PB based on our sprint review conversation with Terrell.
	- As a user, when clicking the Portfolio tab, there should be a drop down focused on reverse engineering any career path, with specific steps on how to follow that career path.
	- As a user, I should see content that tailors my experience based on my age group and specific experience.

## Sprint Retrospective
- 	Action that will make the team significantly better: better communication! Data is being collected from multiple sources for this project. The team needs to ensure all members of the team are kept abreast of all communication with sources outside the team and that all new thoughts, ideas and improvements are properly communicated.
	- 	New PBI - At the beginning of sprint two, the developers recap outside communication, new ideas and improvements that have occurred since the last sprint. This activity will be repeated at the beginning of every scrum.
		- Acceptance Criteria - the developers have performed the communication recap at the beginning of the next sprint and commit to doing so at the beginning of each scrum in the next sprint.
-	A second action that will make team siginifcantly better: more well defined user stories! Some user stories were too broad and too simliar to other user stories which made breaking them down and prioritizing them difficult. For the next sprint, we will be more specific in our user stories and ensure that developement tasks can be easily made out of them!
	-	New PBI - Ensure exisiting user stories are specific. Rework any user stories that are too broad and eliminate similiar user stories. Any new user stories must be specific.
		- Acceptance Critieria - the developers agree the user are well definied and developer tasks can easily be derived from them.
- **Our new PBIs are at the top of our PB in the above screenshot of the PB following Spring Review!**

- General Sprint Retrospective Notes:
	- Consider adding additional team members to foster an environment where collaborative ideas can be manifested to enhance the collective project.
	- Consider adding a silent partner to evaluate performance and our collective work. Often times teams are unable to observe the team's inhibitors due to being so actively engaged in their work.

## SPRINT 2

**Forecast Number of Story Points to Be Completed - 3**

**Rationale** - Using the "Yesterday's Weather" technique, we are setting our set our sprint forecast for sprint three based on what we were able to accomplish in sprint two. We completed three items in sprint two so it makes the most sense for us to forecast three items for spring three. Further, based on our evaluation of the work we completed in sprint two, we want to make sure we can really focus on our three items and complete them to the fullest extent. **Only developers participated in pulling user stories into the sprint backlog.**

## Daily Scrum #2 - 11/20/2022
**Items moved from in progress to DONE (COMPLETED IN LAST 24 HOURS):**
- Retrospective - Data is being collected from multiple sources for this project. Ensure all members of the team are kept abreast of all communication with sources outside the team and that all new thoughts, ideas and improvements are properly communicated. **Completed by Mike and John**
	- Acceptance Criteria - At the beginning of sprint two, the developers recap outside communication, new ideas and improvements that have occurred since the last sprint. This activity will be repeated at the beginning of every scrum. **Completed by Mike and John**
	
- Retrospective - Ensure existing user stories are specific. Rework any user stories that are too broad and eliminate similiar user stories. Any new user stories must be specific. **Completed by Mike and John**
	- Acceptance Critieria - the developers agree the user are well definied and developer tasks can easily be derived from them. **Completed by Mike and John**

## Next 24 Hours for the Sprint:
- Mike
	- Research using AWS as provider for our web server
	- Ensure all user stories in the backlog are true user stories
- John
	- Create developer tasks for three user stories in the sprint backlog
	- Research methods for continous deployment with GitHub and AWS. How automated does this need to be? Confirm with Richard on level of automation.
			
## Questions Answered in Scrum:
- Do you see any impediment that prevents the Developers from meeting the Sprint Goal? 
	- After speaking more with Professor Richard in office hours, we discovered that we have a pretty huge impediment: Wix. We simply are not going to be able to use Wix to meet all the requirements laid out in the grading rubric for the sprint. 
- What are the impediments? 
	- Wix is the main impediment for many different reasons:
		- We can only use Javascript with Wix.
		- We are not going to be able to do contious integration in a manner consitent with class teachings with Wix.
		- We won't really be able to have micro scale unit tests with Wix because Wix requires web access to use the resource and our code and tests will not be platform independent if we are relying on Wix.
		
- What is your impediment removal plan?
	- We have to develop this site in a more traditional manner and leave the Wix platform.
	- This will enable us to develope the code locally, write micro scale unit test and have continous integration and deployment.
	- The development work for sprint two will be done on the new platform and the existing work will need to be migrated over at some point.
