    <p id="intro_section" class="info_section">Hi there! Welcome to RESI-FIT Financial Budgeting Tools! We know that financial budgeting can be <br>
        tough and our aim is to help you understand a few of the concepts while giving you the tools to begin <br>
        your financial budgeting journey!
    </p>
    <div id="fv_calc_banner_1" class="section_banner">RESI-FIT Investment Balance Calculator</div>
    <p id="reasons_to_use_fv_calc", class="info_section">One way to budget financially or to plan for retirement is to project a future savings balance <br>
        based on a current (present) investment amount and a regular contribution amount. This is a good <br>
        approach to budgeting when you have a current amount of money that you would like to invest and <br>
        also have a contribution amount in mind that you can make on a regular basis. You're not <br>
        exactly interested in precise investment balance you will have at the end of your time frame; <br>
        you know what you have now and you know what you can contribute. If this sounds like your <br>
        situation, than the Investment Balance Caculator is a great tool for you to being with! <br>
    </p>
    <div id="fv_how_to_banner" class="section_banner">So how do I use this thing?</div>
    <p id=fv_calc_mechanics" class="info_section">We need to make some assumptions about a few things like the number of periods we would <br>
        like our investment to grow for as well as rate of return for which the growth will occur. <br>
        We strongly encourage you to try a number of different inputs with the Investment Balance Calclulator <br>
        so you can get an idea of how varying the different inputs will affect your Investment Balance. <br>
        Generally speaking, increasing any of the inputs will result in a higher pre-tax investment balance. <br>
        Increasing your tax rate will result in a lower after tax investment balance. Varying the <br>
        frequency of contributions will also increase your projected investment balance. Why? Because <br>
        the compounding of the return will happen more frequently. Essentially, one way of thinking <br>
        is that you will be able to capture your rate of return more frequently and the compounding <br>
        effect will happen more frequently. If you need more of an explanation, here is a link to <br>
        to a good explanation: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp">Compound Interest Investopedia</a>
    </p>
    <div id="cashflow_sign_banner", class="section_banner">Wait, why are some of these calculator values negative?</div>
    <p id="cashflow_sign_info", class="info_section">
        Further, a word is needed on how to supply the values for starting balance and expected <br>
        contribution. In financial math, money paid into an investment is signified as a negative <br>
        amount while money received from an investment is a positive amount. To illustrate, when <br>
        using the Investment Balance Calculator if we specify a starting balance and a contribution <br>
        amount that we plan to pay into the investment, we should specify those as negative amounts <br>
        as, technically, it is money flowing out of our possession and into an investment. If we <br>
        do this and then calculate our expected ending balance, our balance will be a positive <br>
        amount signifying that we will receive this amount of money at the end of the investment. <br>
        We know this can be confusing so here is a resource where you can practice specifying <br>
        positive and negative cashflows: <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/businessmath/chapter/cash-flow-using-signs-negatives-in-formulas/">Cashflow Sign Practice</a>
    </p>
    <div id="input_recs_banner" class="section_banner">Ok I'm ready. What values are realistic inputs?</div>
    <p id="fv_calc_input_recs" class="info_section">
        One more thing before we get started (sorry!). We want to choose realistic values for <br>
        our calculator input parameters. As a matter of fact, the calculator will not let us put <br>
        in certain values that do not make sense. Our input values largely must be numbers. <br>
        We couldn't, for example, enter "dogs" as an input for expected rate of return. Along <br>
        the same line, we should use a resonable number of periods. 30 years tends to be <br>
        a pretty good input number for number of periods but we probably wouldn't want to <br>
        something like 500 years. Why? Well, we probably wont be alive to collect on our investment! <br>
        We can, of course, use that input just to see what would happen but it wouldn't really be a <br>
        time frame for personal financial budgeting. Further, we want to use a reasonable rate of return <br>
        What is a reasonable rate of return? Well, the S&P 500 is an index of 500 different US stocks <br>
        which has averaged around an 8% annual rate of return, historically. That's a decent starting <br>
        point. An unreasonable rate of return would be something like 100% annually. That's not a <br>
        sustainable rate of return. We can see rates of return like that in short periods but <br>
        they are often offset but lower subsequent rates of return. We also want to be conservative. <br>
        We want to make sure we hit our goals and lofty expectation will not get us there!

    <div id="pmt_calc_banner_1", class="section_banner">RESI-FIT Investment Contribution Calculator</div>
    <p id="pmt_calc_use_cases", class="info_section">
        The Investment Balance Calculator is all well and good but what if you have a specfic <br>
        ending investment balance in mind that you want to target? You have some flexibility <br>
        on an initial investment amount as well as how much you can contribute periodically <br>
        but you are dead-set on hitting a target investment balance whether that be for retirement, <br>
        college savings, car savings, etc. Sound like you? Well, we have a calculator for that! <br>
        With the Investment Contribution Calculator, you can specify a starting investment <br>
        and an ending investment balance and the tool will calculate a targeted contribution <br>
        amount to achieve the desired ending balance. As with the Investment Balance Calculator, <br>
        we will need to supply a few inputs such as number of periods and expected rate of return. <br>
        Generally speaking, increasing the current balance, number of periods or expected rate <br>
        of return will lower the targeted contribution amount. Raising the ending investment balance <br>
        will raise the targeted contribution amount.
    </p>
    <div id="pmt_cashflow_sign_banner", class="section_banner">Do I need to use +/- signs for cashflows again?</div>
    <p id="pmt_cashflow_sign_info", class="info_section">
        Just like with the Investment Balance Calculator, we will need to specify positive and <br>
        negative signs for our cashflows. If we are calculating an expected contribution amount <br>
        where we are investing some money upfront and are also specifying a required ending balance <br>
        our starting balance would be negative as that would represent money going into the investment <br>
        and our required ending balance would be positive as it would represent money that we take <br>
        away from the investment at the end of our time period. Now what about our expected contribution <br>
        amount? Will that be a positive or negative? Well, it probably should be a negative if you have <br>
        properly specified your other parameters indicating that you will need to invest a certain amount <br>
        per period to hit your required ending balance. But it might not be negative if, for example, <br>
        you have an ending balance less than your starting balance. A good exercise would be to play <br>
        around with the tool and see how the different inputs affect the sign of the expected contriution amount! <br>

    <div id="assumptions_banner" class="section_banner">Assumptions and Definitions</div>
    <p id="assumptions_section" class="info_section">
        1. Compounding - Our tools assume that the investor will be compounding their rate of return <br>
        at the specified period in the drop-down (years, months, days, etc.) The means <br>
        that we expect the user will reinvest their earnings at the expected rate of return. <br>
        It also means that the investor is not expected to make any withdrawals prior to hitting <br>
        the investment target. Lastly, we assume that the investor will invest any cashflows in the account <br>
        (dividends, etc.) at the expected rate of return.<br>
        2. APR - Annual Percentage Rate. This is the rate of return we expect the investment to earn on <br>
        an annual basis. This number should be net of any fees that will be charged to the account <br>
        so that our projections will be more accurate. More on APR in the following link:
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp">Investopedia APR Article</a><br>
        3.  Our calculators don't allow investors to input negative rates. As we saw at different periods <br>
        thoughout 2009 - 2022, it is entirely possible for investments to have negative interest rates for extended periods <br>
        or time, particularly government debt. That said, it doesn't make any sense to invest in something <br>
        that pays a negative rate of return and we discourage using negative rates as an investment rate of return. <br>
        When investing in a security with a negative rate of return, you essentially make an investment and then <br>
        instead of getting paid a rate of return, you pay the rate of return! This is not a sound investment plan <br>
        and is a sure fire way to financial ruin!<br>
